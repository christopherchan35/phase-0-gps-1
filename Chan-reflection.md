# Reflect
* The concepts of merge and pull were giving me trouble before this
session. This is not to say I have a full understanding of them,
but I am more comfortable using them now.

* Working with Darren really helped me understand the work flow using
merge and pull. The guide, Joey also gave us some help with how pull
is basically fetch and merge combined.

* We didn't ask the guide questions, but he would jump in when we 
started getting off track into researching the fetch command. When 
I was the driver I would double check with Darren for syntactical questions.

* I don't quite have the syntax memorized but that should come with more 
practice. Same goes for the work flow, I have a rough understanding of the 
steps I should take but more practice would really help.

* I enjoyed my first GPS, my partner was fun to work with and we were
able to help each other learn. The guide was suitable for my learning style, 
he was more laid back and only jumped in when we got really stuck. That allowed
us to figure out the solutions to our problems.
