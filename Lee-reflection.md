#GPS Release 7

* I was strugging with the git fetch, pull, and merge commands. 
* We worked through the exercise, our guide jumped in and explained what pull, fetch and merge would do which was very helpful
* Our guide explained that branches can stay on your local repo, delete them now or all at once in months during a cleanup. 
* I want to spend some more time with the fetch command. We tried it earlier but it didn't work as we expected. We ended up using the pull command instead
* I was nervous at first, but I came out of this GPS with a better understanding of why we're pairing. Though I still need to work on giving feedback.
